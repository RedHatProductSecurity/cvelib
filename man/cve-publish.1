.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cve publish
[OPTIONS] CVE_ID
.SH DESCRIPTION
Publish a CVE record for a reserved (or rejected) CVE ID.
.PP
    If the CVE is already published, this action will update its record. A published CVE can only be
    moved to the rejected state with an appropriate reject record (see `cve reject`). A published
    CVE cannot be moved back to the reserved state.
.PP
    The CVE record can be specified as a string:
.PP
      cve publish CVE-2022-1234 -j '{"affected": [], "descriptions": [], "references": {}, ...}'
.PP
    Or passed in a file:
.PP
      cve publish CVE-2022-1234 -f v5_record.json
.PP
    For information on the required properties in a given CVE JSON record, see the schema in:
.PP
    https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/CVE_JSON_5.0_schema.json
.PP
    Because the CVE Services API only expects the cnaPublishedContainer contents of the full record,
    the record you pass to this command can specify just that data, and not the full record.
