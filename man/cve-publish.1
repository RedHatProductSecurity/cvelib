.SH NAME
cve\-publish \- Publish a CNA container of a CVE record...
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cve publish
[OPTIONS] CVE_ID
.SH DESCRIPTION
Publish a CNA container of a CVE record for a reserved (or rejected) CVE ID.
.PP
    If the CVE is already published, this action will update the CNA container in its record. A
    published CVE can only be moved to the rejected state with an appropriate reject record (see
    `cve reject`). A published CVE cannot be moved back to the reserved state.
.PP
    The CNA container can be specified as a string:
.PP
      cve publish CVE-2022-1234 -j '{"affected": [], "descriptions": [], "references": {}, ...}'
.PP
    Or passed in a file:
.PP
      cve publish CVE-2022-1234 -f cve.json
.PP
    For information on the required properties in a given CNA container of a CVE record,
    see the schema in:
.PP
    https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/CVE_JSON_5.0_schema.json
    https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/v5.0/docs/#oneOf_i0_containers_cna
.PP
    Because the CVE Services API only expects the CNA container contents of the full CVE v5 record,
    the data you pass to this command can specify just the attributes defined by the
    cnaPublishedContainer or cnaRejectedContainer subschemas, and not the full schema record.
